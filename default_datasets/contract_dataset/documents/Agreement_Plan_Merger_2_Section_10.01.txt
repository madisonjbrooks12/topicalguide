Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent appointing such new Stockholder Representative shall be sent to Parent, such appointment to be effective upon the later of the date indicated in such consent or the date such notice is received by Parent;   provided , that until such notice is received, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely on the decisions and actions of the prior Stockholder Representative as described in Section 10.01(a) above.(c)          The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the Stockholders, Optionholders or Warrantholders for actions taken pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent such actions shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted gross negligence or involved fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel, accountants and other professionals and experts retained by the Stockholder Representative shall be conclusive evidence of good faith). The Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders shall severally and not jointly (in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares), indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative from and against, compensate it for, reimburse it for and pay any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, arising out of and in connection with its activities as the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (the “ Representative Losses ”), in each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided , that in the event it is finally adjudicated that a Representative Loss or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith of the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative shall reimburse the Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith. The Representative Losses shall be satisfied: (i) from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund; (ii) from any additional amounts the Stockholder Representative directs, in its sole discretion, by written notice to Parent, that Parent add to the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund from the proceeds of any payment that would otherwise be made to Stockholders, Optionholders or Warrantholders from the Escrow Fund or with respect to any Contingent Payment; and (iii) to the extent the amount of the Representative Losses exceeds amounts available to the Stockholder Representative under (i) and (ii), from the Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders, severally and not jointly (in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares). As soon as practicable after the date on which the final obligation of the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement have been discharged or such other date as the Stockholder Representative deems appropriate, the Escrow Agent shall pay any amounts remaining in the Stockholder Representative Fund to the Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, as set forth in the Escrow Agreement.(d)          The Stockholder Representative agrees that it will treat in confidence all documents, materials and other information which it shall have obtained regarding the other parties hereto (i) during the course of the negotiations leading to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) otherwise in connection with the performance of the terms hereof, in each case, whether obtained before or after the date of this Agreement and/or the Closing Date.

Such documents, materials and information shall not be communicated to any third Person (other than, in the case of Parent or Merger Sub, to their counsel, accountants or Affiliates, and in the case of the Securityholders’ Agent, to their counsel or accountants). The Stockholder Representative shall not use any confidential information in any manner whatsoever except solely for the purpose of evaluating the proposed Merger or in connection with its duties hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of the Stockholder Representative to treat such documents, materials and other information in confidence or to limit the use of such documents, materials and other information shall not apply to any information which (a) is or becomes available to the Stockholder Representative from a source other than the Stockholder Representative or its agents, (b) is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Stockholder Representative or its agents, (c) is required to be disclosed under applicable law or judicial process, but only to the extent it must be disclosed or (d) the Stockholder Representative reasonably deems necessary to disclose to obtain any of the consents or approvals contemplated hereby.
