Section 3.11         Intellectual Property. (a)           Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedules lists all (i) Company IP Registrations and (ii) Company Intellectual Property, including software, that are not registered but that are material to the Company's business or operations as currently conducted. All required filings and fees related to the Company IP Registrations have been timely filed with and paid to the relevant Governmental Authorities and authorized registrars, and all Company IP Registrations are otherwise in good standing. The Company has provided Parent with true and complete copies of file histories, documents, certificates, office actions, correspondence and other materials related to all Company IP Registrations.(b)           Section 3.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedules lists all Company IP Agreements. The Company has provided Parent with true and complete copies of all such Company IP Agreements, including all modifications, amendments and supplements thereto and waivers thereunder. Each Company IP Agreement is valid and binding on the Company in accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any other party thereto is in breach of or default under (or is alleged to be in breach of or default under), or has provided or received any notice of breach or default of or any intention to terminate, any Company IP Agreement.(c)          The Company is the sole and exclusive legal and beneficial, and with respect to the Company IP Registrations, record, owner of all right, title and interest in and to the Company Intellectual Property, and has the valid right to use all other Intellectual Property used in or necessary for the conduct of the Company’s current business or operations, in each case pursuant to Company IP Agreements, free and clear of Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for employees who developed the Intellectual Property within the scope of their employment and which results in the Company owning all right, title and interest in such Intellectual Property, and/or who have been a party to “work-made-for-hire” arrangements with the Company and which results in the Company owning all right, title and interest in such Intellectual Property, the Company has entered into binding, written agreements with every current and former employee, and with every current and former independent contractor, whereby such employees and independent contractors assign to the Company any ownership interest and right they may have in such Intellectual Property. The Company has provided Parent with true and complete copies of all such agreements.(d)          The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder will not result in the loss or impairment of or payment of any additional amounts with respect to, nor require the consent of any other Person in respect of, the Company Intellectual Property.(e)          The Company's rights in the Company IP Registrations are valid, subsisting and enforceable. The Company has taken all reasonable steps to maintain the Company Intellectual Property that are material to the business of the Company as currently conducted and to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all trade secrets included in the Company Intellectual Property, including, requiring all Persons having access thereto to execute written non-disclosure agreements.(f)          The conduct of the Company's business as currently and formerly conducted, and the manufacture, use and sale of the Company Products, have not materially infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated, and do not infringe, dilute, misappropriate or otherwise violate, the Intellectual Property rights of any Person. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has materially infringed, misappropriated, diluted or otherwise violated, or is currently infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating, any Company Intellectual Property.(g)          There are no Actions (including any oppositions, interferences or re-examinations) settled, pending or threatened (including in the form of offers to obtain a license): (i) alleging any infringement, misappropriation, dilution or violation of the Intellectual Property of any Person by the Company; (ii) challenging the validity, enforceability, registrability or ownership of any Company Intellectual Property or the Company's rights with respect to any Company Intellectual Property; or (iii) by the Company alleging any infringement, misappropriation, dilution or violation by any Person of the Company Intellectual Property.
