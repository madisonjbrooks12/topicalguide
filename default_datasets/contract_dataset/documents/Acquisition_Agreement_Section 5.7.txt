Section 5.7 Bankruptcy Court Approval .(a) The Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Purchaser has expended considerable time and expense in connection with this Agreement and the negotiation thereof and the identification and quantification of assets of Sellers. In consideration therefor, the Sellers shall, as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than four (4) hours after the time that this Agreement is executed by both the Sellers and the Purchaser, file with and seek the approval of the Bankruptcy Court of the Stalking Horse Motion, including the Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement Amount, and the entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Stalking Horse Order approving the payment of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement and deeming the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Amount as administrative priority expenses under Sections 503(b) and 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Stalking Horse Order no later than February 6, 2015 (which may be extended to no later than February 9, 2015, at the election of the Sellers upon written notice to the Purchaser, solely in the event of any closure of the Bankruptcy Court, natural disaster, act of God or other similar force majeure type event, in each case, that precludes the Sellers from obtaining entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Stalking Horse Order on February 6, 2015). The Sellers and the Purchaser agree that the Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement Amount were together a material inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall be payable as specified herein.(b) The Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge that this Agreement and the sale of the Acquired Assets are subject to Bankruptcy Court approval. The Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge that (i) to obtain such approval, the Sellers must demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to obtain the highest or otherwise best offer possible for the Acquired Assets, including giving notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to creditors and certain other interested parties as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, and, if necessary, conducting an auction in respect of the Acquired Assets (the “ Auction ”), and (ii) the Purchaser must provide adequate assurance of future performance under the Assigned Contracts and Assumed Leases included in the Acquired Assets.(c) The Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Bankruptcy Court to enter the Sale Order. The Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Sale Order no later than twenty-eight (28) days after the date hereof.(d) The Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in connection with the Sale Order, the Bidding Procedures Order, the Stalking Horse Order, and the bankruptcy proceedings in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, consulting with the Purchaser at the Purchaser’s reasonable request concerning the status of such proceedings. The Sellers further covenant and agree that the terms of any plan they submit to the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation shall not conflict with, supersede, abrogate, nullify or restrict the terms of this Agreement, or in any way prevent or interfere with the consummation or performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, any transaction contemplated by or approved pursuant to the Sale Order, the Bidding Procedures Order or the Stalking Horse Order.(e) In the event an appeal is taken or a stay pending appeal is requested, from either the Stalking Horse Order or the Sale Order, the Sellers shall promptly notify the Purchaser of such appeal or stay request and shall promptly provide to the Purchaser a copy of the related notice of appeal or order of stay. The Sellers shall also provide the Purchaser with written notice of any motion or application filed in connection with any appeal from either of such orders.(f) From and after the Effective Date, and to the extent the Purchaser is the Successful Bidder at the Auction, the Sellers shall not take any action that is intended to result in, or fail to take any action the intent of which failure to act would result in, the reversal, voiding, modification or staying of the Bidding Procedures Order, the Stalking Horse Order or the Sale Order or that would be inconsistent with this Agreement.(g) If an Auction is conducted and the Purchaser is not the Successful Bidder at the conclusion of such Auction, the Purchaser shall be required to serve as the Back-Up Bidder if the Purchaser is the next highest or otherwise next best bidder at the Auction (such party that is the next highest or otherwise next best bidder at the Auction, the “ Back-Up Bidder ”) and, if the Purchaser is the Back-Up Bidder, the Purchaser shall be required to keep its bid to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon by the Purchaser in the Auction) open and irrevocable until the earlier of (i) 5:00 p.m. (prevailing Eastern Time) on the date that is eighty-two (82) days following the Effective Date, (ii) 60 days following the entry of the Sale Order as to the Successful Bidder or (iii) the closing of the transaction with the Successful Bidder. The Purchaser agrees that if the Purchaser is the Back-Up Bidder, any order approving a sale of some or all of the Acquired Assets to the Successful Bidder shall, subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, provide that if the Successful Bidder fails to consummate the sale transaction, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have the new prevailing bid, and the Sellers shall be required (provided that nothing herein shall require the Sellers or any directors or officers of the Sellers (in such person’s capacity as a director or officer of the Sellers) to take any action, or to refrain from taking any action, to the extent such action or forbearance is inconsistent with its or their fiduciary obligations under applicable law, as determined after consultation with outsidelegal counsel), without further order of the Bankruptcy Court, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon by the Purchaser in the Auction) with the Purchaser.(h) The Sellers shall serve notice of the Stalking Horse Motion, the Stalking Horse Order, this Agreement, the proposed Sale Order and all deadlines and material facts relating to the foregoing to all parties entitled to receive notice thereof pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order and the Stalking Horse Motion and such notice is sufficient under applicable Law to enable the Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the sale of the Acquired Assets to the Purchaser free and clear of all Encumbrances to the full extent set forth in the Sale Order.
