Section 8.1 Tax Matters .(a) Parent shall file, or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account any applicable extensions) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Non-Debtor Subs on or prior to the Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns, to the extent permitted under applicable Law. The Tax Returns of the Non-Debtor Subs shall be prepared in accordance with the past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.(b) All sales, use, excise, transfer, documentary, stamp, value added, recordation, license, conveyance and other similar Taxes (“ Transfer Taxes ”), if any, payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by the Purchaser and paid when due. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to reduce or eliminate any Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The Purchaser shall be responsible for preparing and filing all Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes and shall file all such Tax Returns when due; provided , however , that in the event any such Tax Return requires execution by the Sellers, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers a draft copy of such Tax Return a reasonable amount of time prior to the due date thereof for the Seller’s review and comment, and the Sellers shall promptly execute such Tax Return and deliver it to Purchaser three (3) Business Days before the due date thereof, who shall cause it to be filed.(c) As to any Acquired Asset acquired by the Purchaser, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall apportion the liability for real and personal property Taxes, ad valorem Taxes, and similar Taxes (“ Periodic Taxes ”) for all Tax periods including but not ending on the Closing Date applicable to such Acquired Asset (all such periods of time being hereinafter called “ Proration Periods ”). The Periodic Taxes described in this Section 8.1(c) shall be apportioned between the Sellers and the Purchaser as of the Closing Date, with the Purchaser liable for that portion of the Periodic Taxes equal to the Periodic Tax for the Proration Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the applicable Proration Period after the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days covered by such Proration Period. The Sellers shall be liable for that portion of the Periodic Taxes for a Proration Period for which the Purchaser is not liable under the preceding sentence. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall pay or be reimbursed for Periodic Taxes (including instances in which such Periodic Taxes have been paid before the Closing Date) on this prorated basis at Closing. To the extent the liability for Periodic Taxes for a certain Proration Period is not determinable at the time of Closing or such Periodic Taxes are charged in arrears, such Periodic Taxes shall be prorated for such Proration Period, based on the most recent ascertainable full tax year without adjustment. The party hereto responsible under applicable Law for paying a Tax described in this Section 8.1(c) shall be responsible for administering the payment of such Tax. For purposes of this Section 8.1(c) , the Proration Period for ad valorem Taxes and real and personal property Taxes shall be the fiscal period for which such Taxes were assessed by the applicable Tax jurisdiction.(d) The Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, as the case may be (the “ Reimbursing Party ”), shall provide reimbursement for any Tax paid by the other (the “ Paying Party ”), all or a portion of which is the responsibility of the Reimbursing Party in accordance with the terms of this Section 8.1 or which represents an overpayment for Taxes by the Paying Party. Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any such Tax, the Paying Party shall give notice to the Reimbursing Party of the Tax payable and the Paying Party’s and Reimbursing Party’s respective liability therefor, although failure to do so will not relieve the Reimbursing Party from its liability hereunder except to the extent the Reimbursing Party is prejudiced thereby.(e) Other than as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall take, or cause or permit any other Person to take, any action which could (i) materially increase any Seller’s or any of its Affiliates’ liability for Taxes or (ii) result in, or change the character of, any material item of income or gain that must be reported on any Tax Return filed or to be filed by or with respect to any Seller or any of its Affiliates (including any Tax Return filed or required to be filed by any Non-Debtor Sub for a taxable year or period ending after the Closing Date).
