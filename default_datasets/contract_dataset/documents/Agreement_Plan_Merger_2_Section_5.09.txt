Section 5.09          Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.(a)          Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company (each an “ D&O Indemnified Party ”) as provided in the Company Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof and disclosed in Section 5.09 of the Disclosure Schedules, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding or claim.(b)          For six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent and the Surviving Corporation (the “ D&O Indemnifying Parties ”) shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each D&O Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and shall reimburse each D&O Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such D&O Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporation's receipt of an undertaking by such D&O Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such D&O Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law; provided , however , that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).(c)          Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain and fully pay for “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amount and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company as the Company's existing policies with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the “ D&O Tail Policy ”). The Company shall bear the cost of the D&O Tail Policy, and such costs, to the extent not paid prior to the Closing, shall be included in the determination of Transaction Expenses. During the term of the D&O Tail Policy, Parent shall not (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) take any action following the Closing to cause the D&O Tail Policy to be cancelled or any provision therein to be amended or waived; provided , that neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any Affiliate thereof shall be obligated to pay any premiums or other amounts in respect of such D&O Tail Policy.(d)          The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.09 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any D&O Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.09 applies without the consent of such affected D&O Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the D&O Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.09 applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.09 , each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.09 ).(e)          In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.09 . The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.09 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.
