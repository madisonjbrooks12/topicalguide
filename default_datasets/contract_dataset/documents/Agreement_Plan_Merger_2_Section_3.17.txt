The Company has separately identified in Section 3.17(a) of the Disclosure Schedules (i) each Benefit Plan that contains a change in control provision and (ii) each Benefit Plan that is maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by the Company primarily for the benefit of employees outside of the United States (a “ Non-U.S. Benefit Plan ”).(b)          With respect to each Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to Parent accurate, current and complete copies of each of the following: (i) where the Benefit Plan has been reduced to writing, the plan document together with all amendments; (ii) where the Benefit Plan has not been reduced to writing, a written summary of all material plan terms; (iii) where applicable, copies of any trust agreements or other funding arrangements, custodial agreements, insurance policies and contracts, administration agreements and similar agreements, and investment management or investment advisory agreements, now in effect or required in the future as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise; (iv) copies of any summary plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications, employee handbooks and any other written communications (or a description of any oral communications) relating to any Benefit Plan; (v) in the case of any Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, a copy of the most recent determination, opinion or advisory letter from the Internal Revenue Service; (vi) in the case of any Benefit Plan for which a Form 5500 is required to be filed, a copy of the three most recently filed Form 5500, with schedules and financial statements attached; (vii) actuarial valuations and reports related to any Benefit Plans with respect to the three most recently completed plan years; (viii) the most recent nondiscrimination tests performed under the Code; and (ix) copies of material notices, letters or other correspondence from the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or other Governmental Authority relating to the Benefit Plan.(c)          Each Benefit Plan and any related trust has been established, administered and maintained materially in accordance with its terms and in material compliance with all applicable Laws (including ERISA, the Code and any applicable local Laws). Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (a “ Qualified Benefit Plan ”) is so qualified and has received a favorable and current determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, or with respect to a prototype plan, can rely on an opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the prototype plan sponsor, to the effect that such Qualified Benefit Plan is so qualified and that the plan and the trust related thereto are exempt from federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Qualified Benefit Plan. Nothing has occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan that has subjected or could reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates or, with respect to any period on or after the Closing Date, Parent or any of its Affiliates, to a penalty under Section 502 of ERISA or to Tax or penalty under Section 4975 of the Code. All benefits, contributions and premiums relating to each Benefit Plan have been timely paid in accordance with the terms of such Benefit Plan and all applicable Laws and accounting principles, and all benefits accrued under any unfunded Benefit Plan have been paid, accrued or otherwise adequately reserved to the extent required by, and in accordance with, GAAP. All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans that are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved are funded and/or book-reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.(d)          No Benefit Plan is and neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates maintains, contributes to, is required to contribute to, or has any Liability or obligation (contingent or otherwise) under or with respect to, a “multiemployer plan” (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA), a “multiple employer welfare arrangement” (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), a “multiple employer plan” (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code), or a pension plan that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.(e)          Each Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in accordance with its terms, without material liabilities to Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates other than ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event. The Company has no commitment or obligation and has not made any representations to any employee, officer, director, independent contractor or consultant, whether or not legally binding, to adopt, amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan or any collective bargaining agreement, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.(f)          Other than as required under Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA or other applicable Law, no Benefit Plan provides post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to any individual for any reason, and neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any Liability to provide post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to any individual or ever represented, promised or contracted to any individual that such individual would be provided with post-termination or retiree welfare benefits.(g)          There is no pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened Action relating to a Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), and no Benefit Plan has within the three years prior to the date hereof been the subject of an examination or audit by a Governmental Authority or the subject of an application or filing under or is a participant in, an amnesty, voluntary compliance, self-correction or similar program sponsored by any Governmental Authority.(h)          There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Benefit Plan or collective bargaining agreement that would increase the annual expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred for the most recently completed fiscal year with respect to any director, officer, employee, independent contractor or consultant, as applicable. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has any commitment or obligation or has made any representations to any director, officer, employee, independent contractor or consultant, whether or not legally binding, to adopt, amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan or any collective bargaining agreement.(i)          Each Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has been administered in compliance with its terms and the operational and documentary requirements of Section 409A of the Code and all applicable regulatory guidance (including notices, rulings and proposed and final regulations) thereunder. The Company does not have any obligation to gross up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise Taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.(j)          Each individual who is classified by the Company as an independent contractor has been properly classified for purposes of participation and benefit accrual under each Benefit Plan.(k)           Neither the execution of this Agreement nor any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events): (i) entitle any current or former director, officer, employee, independent contractor or consultant of the Company to severance pay or any other payment; (ii) accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to any such individual; (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company to merge, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan; (iv) increase the amount payable under or result in any other material obligation pursuant to any Benefit Plan; (v) result in “excess parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code; or (vi) require a “gross-up” or other payment to any “disqualified individual” within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code.
