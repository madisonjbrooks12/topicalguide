Section 3.15 Employee Benefit Matters .(a) Section 3.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list of each Assumed Benefit Plan and each material Benefit Plan as of the Effective Date. The Sellers have made available to the Purchaser copies of documents embodying each of the material Benefit Plans, including each Assumed Benefit Plan. The Sellers have furnished the Purchaser with the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination or opinion letter issued with respect to each Benefit Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of any such Benefit Plan.(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect: (i) each Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with applicable Law; (ii) none of the Benefit Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person except as required by applicable Law; (iii) all contributions and payments required to be made by the Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate to any Benefit Plan have been paid when due; and (iv) no Action (other than routine claims for benefits) is currently pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, is currently threatened, against or with respect to any Benefit Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or United States Department of Labor.(c) No Seller or any ERISA Affiliate has, within the six (6)-year period prior to the date hereof, ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, contributed to, or has been obligated to contribute to, or otherwise incurred any obligation or liability (including any contingent liability) under any “multiemployer plan” (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or to any “pension plan” (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has any actual or potential withdrawal liability for any complete or partial withdrawal (as defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA) from any multiemployer plan.(d) The consummation of the Acquisition, whether alone or in combination with any other event, will not (i) entitle any current or former employee of the Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate to severance benefits or any other payment (including unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or benefits) under any Assumed Benefit Plan; or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits or increase the amount of compensation due any such current or former employee under any Assumed Benefit Plan.
