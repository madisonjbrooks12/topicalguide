Section 2.09     Treatment of Options, Company Warrants and Corporate Actions.(a)      At the Effective Time, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Optionholder or any other Person, cancelled and each Optionholder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive with respect to In-Money Options (i) equal amounts of cash, without interest, and Merger Shares, the aggregate value of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such In-Money Option, multiplied by (y) the excess of the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price under such In-Money Option, and (ii) any amounts that may become payable in respect of such In-Money Option in the future from the Contingent Payments or in respect of the Post-Closing Adjustment, in each case, at the respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and subject to Section 2.15 . After the Effective Time, each Optionholder shall only be entitled to the payments described in this Section 2.09(a) . For the avoidance of doubt, all Out-of-Money Options shall be cancelled and shall not have any right to receive any consideration in respect thereof. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions necessary to (i) effectuate the provisions of Section 2.09(a) and (ii) cause the Stock Option Plan to terminate at or prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing shall prohibit the Company from entering into Option Exercise Notes between the date hereof and Closing. To the extent any Optionholder enters into an Option Exercise Note with the Company, such Optionholder will be a Stockholder as of the Closing for the purposes of this Agreement subject only to the terms of the Option Exercise Note with respect to payment of amounts due the Company thereunder.(b)      As of Closing, each agreement evidencing company warrants to purchase Shares (a “ Company Warrant ”) that is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement (each such Company Warrant being referred to herein as an “ Outstanding Warrant ”) and terminates in accordance with its terms upon the Closing, shall be cancelled, terminated and extinguished as of the Effective Time, and upon the cancellation thereof be converted into the right to receive, in respect of each Share then vested and subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to such cancellation, termination and extinguishment: (i) equal amounts of cash, without interest, and Merger Shares, the aggregate value of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Shares previously subject to such Company Warrant, multiplied by (y) the excess of the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration over the per Share exercise price previously subject to such Company Warrant (it being understood that, if the exercise price payable in respect of such Shares issuable under any Company Warrant exceeds the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration, the amount payable hereunder with respect to such Company Warrant shall be zero), and (ii) any amounts that may become payable in respect of such Company Warrants in the future from the Contingent Payments or in respect of the Post-Closing Adjustment, in each case, at the respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and subject to Section 2.15 . The Company shall use reasonable commercial efforts to terminate, cancel and effectuate the release of all Outstanding Warrants prior to the Effective Time. To the extent that any Company Warrant has not been exercised at the Effective Time and is not terminable pursuant to its terms, the Stockholder Representative shall use reasonable commercial efforts to effectuate their release.
