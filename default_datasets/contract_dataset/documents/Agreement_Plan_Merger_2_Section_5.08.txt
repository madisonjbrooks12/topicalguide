Each party shall cooperate fully with the other party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents, authorizations, orders and approvals.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Company shall amend, modify, supplement or waive the terms and conditions of any Material Contract listed in the Company’s Disclosure Schedules without the prior consent of the other, nor shall either of them be obligated to pay or to commit to pay to any Person whose consent, waiver or approval is being sought any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such Person in connection with such consent, waiver or approval, except for immaterial customary fees and expenses expressly imposed by the terms of any such Material Contract.(c)          Without limiting the generality of the parties' undertakings pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) above, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to:(i)          respond to any inquiries by any Governmental Authority regarding antitrust or other matters with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document;(ii)         avoid the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that would restrain, alter or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document; and(iii)        in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document has been issued, to have such Governmental Order vacated or lifted.(d)          All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions between the Company and Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Law or any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each party shall give notice to the other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other party with the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.(e)          Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.08 shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or any of its Affiliates to agree to (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or interests of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) any conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets, businesses or interests which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) any material modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
