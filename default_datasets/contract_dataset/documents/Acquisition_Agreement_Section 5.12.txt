Section 5.12 Employee Matters .(a) As of the Closing, the Purchaser shall assume the Assumed Benefit Plans and thereafter shall perform or cause to be performed all obligations of the Sellers with respect to the Assumed Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of the Closing.(b) Each of the individuals employed by the Sellers shall receive an offer of employment from the Purchaser at least fifteen (15) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, or within five (5) Business Days of the applicable date of hire with respect to any such individual hired by the Sellers within the fifteen (15)-day period prior to the Closing Date. Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.12(b) , each offer of employment shall provide substantially the same terms and conditions in the aggregate as provided to such individual by the Sellers as of immediately prior to the Closing and provide that employment with the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall commence effective as of the Closing. Each individual who accepts the offer of employment pursuant to the prior sentence shall be deemed a “ Transferred Employee ” as of the Closing. For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall or shall cause one of its Affiliates to provide each Transferred Employee with (i) base salary or wage rates that are not less than those in effect for each such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) annual incentive compensation opportunity, including equity compensation, and employee benefits, that are no worse than those in effect for similarly situated employees of the Purchaser. The Sellers shall cease to employ the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each Transferred Employee who is terminated without cause by the Purchaser or one of its Affiliates during the one-year period that begins immediately following the Closing, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide such Transferred Employee with the same change of control severance payments and benefits as provided by the Sellers and its Affiliates under the Benefit Plan in which the Transferred Employee was participating in immediately prior to Closing which would be either under the Dendreon Corporation Severance Benefits Plan for Executive-Level Employees (Vice Presidents and above) or the Dendreon Corporation Severance Benefits Plan for Executive Director-Level and Below Employees.(c) The Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide to each Transferred Employee full credit for such Transferred Employee’s service with the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing for all purposes, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accruals and determination of the level of benefits (including vacation, severance and retirement benefits), under any benefit plan in which such Transferred Employee participates on or following the Closing (including severance as provided under Section 5.12(b) herein) to the same extent recognized by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing; provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or coverage. The Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to: (i) waive any limitation on health and welfare coverage of such Transferred Employees due to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, active employment requirements, and requirements to show evidence of good health under any applicable health and welfare plan of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to the extent such Transferred Employees were covered under a similar Benefit Plan and (ii) credit each such Transferred Employee with all eligible payments, co-payments and co-insurance paid by suchemployee under any Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date during the year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee has satisfied any applicable deductible and whether such employee has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any benefit plan of the Purchaser or any Affiliate for such year.(d) Nothing in this Section 5.12 shall constitute or be construed as (i) an amendment, termination or other modification of any employee benefit or compensation plan or arrangement, or a restriction or other limitation on the right of any party hereto to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any such plans or arrangements, or (ii) a guarantee of employment for any period, or a restriction or other limitation on the right of any party hereto to terminate the employment of any individual at any time.
