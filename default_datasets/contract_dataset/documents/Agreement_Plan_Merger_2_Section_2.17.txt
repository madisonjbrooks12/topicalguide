Section 2.17     Working Capital Adjustment.(a)       Closing Adjustment.(i)      At least five (5) Business Days before the Closing, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement setting forth its good faith estimate of Closing Working Capital (the “ Estimated Closing Working Capital ”), which statement shall contain an estimated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein), a calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital (the “ Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement ”), and a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Company that the Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year end as if such Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement was being prepared and audited as of a fiscal year end.(ii)     The “ Estimated Closing Adjustment ” (which may be either a positive or negative number) shall be an amount equal to the Estimated Closing Working Capital minus the Target Working Capital.(b)       Post-Closing Adjustment.(i)     Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative an unaudited statement setting forth its calculation of Closing Working Capital, which statement shall contain a balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein), a calculation of Closing Working Capital (the “ Closing Working Capital Statement ”) and a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Parent that the Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year end.(ii)      The “ Post-Closing Adjustment ” (which may be either a positive or negative number) shall be an amount equal to the Closing Working Capital minus the Estimated Closing Working Capital; provided , that no adjustment will be made unless the variance to the Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater than $100,000 (the “ Threshold Adjustment Amount ”).(c)       Examination and Review.(i)       Examination. After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement, the Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days (the “ Review Period ”) to review the Closing Working Capital Statement. During the Review Period, the Stockholder Representative and its accountants shall have full access to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation, the personnel of, and work papers prepared by, Parent and/or its accountants to the extent that they relate to the Closing Working Capital Statement and to such historical financial information (to the extent in Parent's possession) relating to the Closing Working Capital Statement as the Stockholder Representative may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Working Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of Objections (defined below), provided , that such access shall be in a manner that does not interfere with the normal business operations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.(ii)       Objection. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the Stockholder Representative may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by delivering to Parent a written statement setting forth its objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for its disagreement therewith (the “ Statement of Objections ”). If the Stockholder Representative fails to deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Stockholder Representative. If the Stockholder Representative delivers the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Statement of Objections (the “ Resolution Period ”), and, if the same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the Closing Working Capital Statement with such changes as may have been previously agreed in writing by Parent and the Stockholder Representative, shall be final and binding.(iii)       Resolution of Disputes. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent fail to reach an agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts remaining in dispute (“ Disputed Amounts ” and any amounts not so disputed, the “ Undisputed Amounts ”) shall be submitted for resolution to the office of KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is unable to serve, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall appoint by mutual agreement the office of an impartial nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants (the “ Independent Accountant ”) who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing Adjustment, as the case may be, and the Closing Working Capital Statement. The parties hereto agree that all adjustments shall be made without regard to materiality. The Independent Accountant shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the parties and its decision for each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such item in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Statement of Objections, respectively.(iv)       Fees of the Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be paid by the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders), on the one hand, and by Parent, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the amount actually contested but not awarded to the Stockholder Representative or Parent, respectively, bears to the aggregate amount actually contested by the Stockholder Representative and Parent. Any such fees and expenses payable by the Stockholder Representative shall be paid from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund to the extent available.(v)      Determination by Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty (30) days (or such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in writing) after their engagement, and their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments to the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, absent fraud or manifest error.(d)       Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment.(i)     If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number less than the Threshold Adjustment Amount, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment, jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Escrow Fund by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Parent, the Post-Closing Adjustment payable in cash.(ii)     If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number greater than the Threshold Adjustment Amount, Parent shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment, deposit with the Exchange Agent, for distribution to the Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, such Stockholders', Optionholders’ and Warrantholders’ aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Post-Closing Adjustment payable in cash, subject to the limitation set forth in Section 2.19 .(e)       Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to Section 2.17 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.
