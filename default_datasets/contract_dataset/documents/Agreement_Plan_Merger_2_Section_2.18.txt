Section 2.18     Contingent Payments.(a)       MIST Payments . Subsequent to and contingent on NICE publishing a technology appraisal guidance that supports the case for the adoption of utilizing MIST Products in therapy (“ NICE Approval ”) prior to January 1, 2017 (the “ NICE Approval Date ”), within sixty (60) days of the end of each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 (the “ 2016 Fiscal Year ”), December 31, 2017 (the “ 2017 Fiscal Year ”), and December 31, 2018 (the “ 2018 Fiscal Year ” and together with the 2016 Fiscal Year and 2017 Fiscal Year, the “ MIST Payment Fiscal Years ”), Parent shall determine the amount of MIST Net Sales for such MIST Payment Fiscal Year, and the excess, if any, over the MIST Net Sales for the Reference Period (“ Excess MIST Net Sales ”). Provided that there are Excess MIST Net Sales for a MIST Payment Fiscal Year, then Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, deliver to the Exchange Agent cash equal to the product of (i) the Excess MIST Net Sales for the applicable MIST Payment Fiscal Year and (ii) twenty percent (20%) (a “ Mist Payment ”). Parent shall make a MIST Payment for any MIST Payment Fiscal Year in one amount to the Exchange Agent, which shall distribute the MIST Payment to the Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders on a Pro Rata Share basis. Simultaneous with the payment of each annual MIST Payment, if any, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of such MIST Payment. The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to object to the MIST Payment calculation and any such objection shall be considered an “Earn-Out Objection Notice” subject to the provisions of Section 2.18(c). If Parent has not received an Earn-Out Objection Notice within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of the MIST Payments from Parent, the Exchange Agent shall disburse the MIST Payments by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.(b)      MIST Shares . Subject to the NICE Approval being issued prior to the NICE Approval Date, within ten (10) Business Days of NICE Approval, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent a number of Parent Shares with an aggregate value of $500,000, based on the numerical average of the volume weighted average prices on Nasdaq for one Parent Share for the forty five (45) consecutive trading days immediately preceding publication of the NICE ruling (the “ MIST Shares ”). The Exchange Agent shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Parent Share certificates representing the MIST Shares, deliver to the Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders the MIST Shares on a Pro Rata Share basis.(c)       Earn-Out Consideration .(i)      Within sixty (60) days of the end of each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2015 (the “ 2015 Fiscal Year ”) and the 2016 Fiscal Year (the 2015 Fiscal Year and the 2016 Fiscal Year, the “ Earn-Out Fiscal Years ”), Parent shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a statement (the “ Preliminary Revenue Statement ”) showing the amount of Company Revenue for such Earn-Out Fiscal Year, and the excess, if any, over the Revenue Target. For the purposes of this Agreement, the “ Revenue Target ” shall be: (a) with respect to the 2015 Fiscal Year, an amount equal to Company Revenues as set forth in the Company’s 2014 Audited Financial Statements; and (b) with respect to the 2016 Fiscal Year, the greater of (x) the Revenue Target for the 2015 Fiscal Year and (y) Company Revenues for the 2015 Fiscal Year. The Preliminary Revenue Statement shall be certified by the chief financial officer of Parent or another senior executive officer of Parent, in such officer’s capacity as an officer and not is his capacity as an individual, to have been calculated in a manner consistent with GAAP and the Company’s practices for determining revenue prior to the Closing.(ii)      Following the delivery of the Preliminary Revenue Statement to the Stockholder Representative, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall afford the Stockholder Representative the opportunity to examine the Preliminary Revenue Statement, and such supporting schedules, analyses, work papers and other underlying records or documentation as are reasonably necessary and appropriate.(iii)      If within ten (10) days following delivery of the Preliminary Revenue Statement or the MIST Payments to the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative has not delivered to Parent written notice (the “ Earn Out Objection Notice ”) of its objections to the Preliminary Revenue Statement or MIST Payments specifying (i) those items as to which there is disagreement and (ii) a reasonably detailed description of the basis, nature, dollar amount and extent of the dispute or disagreement, then the Preliminary Revenue Statement and MIST Payments shall be deemed final and conclusive (the “ Final Revenue Statement ”). If the Stockholder Representative delivers the Earn Out Objection Notice within such 10-day period, then Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections, for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) days from the date of delivery of the Earn Out Objection Notice. If at the end of the fifteen (15) day period there are any objections that remain in dispute, then the remaining objections in dispute shall be submitted for resolution to the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, shall determine any unresolved items of Company Revenue or MIST Payments within thirty (30) days after the objections that remain in dispute are submitted to it. If any such remaining objections are submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution, (i) each party shall furnish to the Independent Accountant such work papers and other documents and information relating to such objections as the Independent Accountant may reasonably request and are available to that party, and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent Accountant any material relating to the determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such determination with the Independent Accountant, (ii) to the extent that a value has been assigned to any objection that remains in dispute, the Independent Accountant shall not assign a value to such objection that is greater than the greatest value for such objection claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such objection claimed by either party, (iii) the determination by the Independent Accountant of such unresolved items of Company Revenue or MIST Payments, as set forth in a written notice delivered to Parent and the Stockholder Representative by the Independent Accountant, shall be made in accordance with this Agreement and shall be deemed the Final Revenue Statement or MIST Payment and binding and conclusive on the parties absent manifest error or fraud, and (iv) the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be paid by the party whose calculation of Company Revenue or MIST Payment deviated the most from the Company Revenue or MIST Payment, as the case may be, as determined by the Independent Accountant.(iv)      Provided that the Company Revenue (as shown on the Final Revenue Statement) for an Earn-Out Fiscal Year exceeds the Revenue Target (the amount of such excess, the “ Excess Revenue ”), then Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, deliver to the Exchange Agent (i) a number of Parent Shares that is equal to the quotient of (A) a fraction the numerator of which is (x) the Excess Revenue multiplied by (y) three and one-half and the denominator of which is (z) two and (B) the Parent Volume Weighted Average Price, and such number of shares shall be the “ Earn-Out Shares ”; and (ii) cash equal to the product of (A)(1) the Excess Revenue multiplied by (2) three and one-half divided by (B) two (the “ Earn-Out Cash ” and together with the Earn-Out Shares, the “ Earn-Out Consideration ”);   provided ,  however , that in no event shall the maximum number of Parent Shares so delivered and constituting Earn-out Consideration and MIST Shares exceed 9,500,000 Parent Shares (the “ Earn-Out Shares Cap ”); provided further , however, in the event that the number of Earn-Out Shares exceeds the Earn-Out Shares Cap, then Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent an amount in cash equal to the product of (I) that portion of the Earn-Out Shares in excess of the Earn-Out Shares Cap and (II) Parent Volume Weighted Average Price, but in no event shall any cash payments exceed the limitation set forth in Section 2.19 . The Exchange Agent shall, no later than ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Earn-Out Consideration, deliver to the Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders the Earn-Out Consideration on a Pro Rata Share basis.(d)       Extraordinary Transaction . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event of an Extraordinary Transaction during any Earn-Out Fiscal Year, the Stockholder Representative shall have the right, at the Stockholder Representative’s option, either to (1) elect to cause Parent to deliver the Change of Control Payment to the Exchange Agent or (2) retain its rights to any remaining Contingent Payments after the Extraordinary Transaction on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Upon delivery of the Change of Control Payment to the Exchange Agent, the Stockholders, Optionholders and Warrantholders shall have no further rights to any Contingent Payments. For purposes of this Agreement, an “ Extraordinary Transaction ” shall be: (a) an acquisition after the date hereof by an individual or legal entity or “group” (as described in Rule 13d-5(b)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act) of effective control (whether through legal or beneficial ownership of capital stock of Parent, by contract or otherwise) of in excess of 50% of the voting securities of Parent, (b) Parent merges into or consolidates with any other Person, or any Person merges into or consolidates with Parent and, after giving effect to such transaction, the stockholders of Parent immediately prior to such transaction own less than 50% of the aggregate voting power of Parent or the successor entity of such transaction, (c) Parent sells or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to another Person and the stockholders of Parent immediately prior to such transaction own less than 50% of the aggregate voting power of the acquiring entity immediately after the transaction or (d) any transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which Parent and/or Affiliates of Parent sell, license or otherwise divest to a third party all or substantially all of the Company's business and assets.(e)       Efforts.
