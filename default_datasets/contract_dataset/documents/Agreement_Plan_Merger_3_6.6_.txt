6.6   Tax Matters .(a)   Acquiror shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Target for all Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date that are due to be filed after the Closing Date.  All Tax Returns to be prepared pursuant to this Section 6.6(a) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice.  The Acquiror shall provide to Holdings for its review and approval a copy of such Tax Returns described in this Section 6.6(a) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return (including extensions), such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  If Holdings does not provide Acquiror with a written description of the items in the Tax Returns that it intends to dispute within ten days (10) days following the delivery to it of such documents, it shall be deemed to have accepted and approved such documents in the form provided and shall sign such Tax Returns.  Acquiror and Holdings agree to consult with each other and to resolve in good faith any timely-raised issue arising as a result of the review of such Tax Returns to permit the filing of such Tax Returns as promptly as possible.  In the event the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within ten (10) days following the delivery of written notice by Holdings of such dispute, Holdings and Acquiror shall jointly request an Independent Accountant (as defined in Section 7.5(f) below) to resolve any issue in dispute before the due date of such Tax Return, in order that such Tax Return may be timely filed.  The Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect to any disputed issue.  Holdings and Acquiror shall each bear one-half of the Independent Accountant’s fees and expenses, and the determination of the Independent Accountant’s shall be binding on all parties.(b)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Acquiror nor Target will, following the Closing, make any change, modification or amendment to any Return (other than a change, modification or amendment which is required to be made by applicable Laws) if such change, modification or amendment would result in any indemnity obligation under this Agreement, unless Acquiror and the Holdings each have consented in advance thereto in writing.   Acquiror shall not, without Holdings’ consent, file a Return for a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date in a jurisdiction in which Target did not previously file Returns.(c)   The Parties shall provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the others in connection with the preparation of any Return, any audit or other examination by any taxing authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liabilities for Taxes. Such assistance shall include making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of relevant Returns and supporting material. The Parties will provide each other with any records or information that may be relevant to such preparation, audit, examination, proceeding or determination.(d)   Any Tax sharing or similar agreements with respect to or involving the Target shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, neither Acquiror nor the Target shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.(e)   If, subsequent to the Closing, any of Acquiror, Target or the Stockholder Representative receives notice of a Tax claim by any Governmental Authority that, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment hereunder (a “ Tax Claim ”), then within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of such notice, Acquiror, Target or the Stockholder Representative, as the case may be, shall give written notice of such Tax Claim to the other parties. The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the conduct and resolution of any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period. Acquiror shall keep the Stockholder Representative informed of all developments on a timely basis with respect to any audit controlled by Acquiror relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period and will not resolve any related Tax Claim which may give rise to any indemnity obligation under this Agreement unless the Stockholder Representative has consented in advance thereto in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each Party shall bear its own costs incurred in participating in any proceeding relating to any Tax Claim.(f)   Following the Closing Date, Acquiror will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue at least one significant historic business line of Target, or use at least a significant portion of Target’s historic business assets in a business, in each case within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(d) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code. It is acknowledged and agreed that, the Merger together with the Final Merger shall be reported and treated by the parties to this Agreement as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (and any comparable provisions of applicable state or local tax laws) and each of the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger together with the Final Merger to meet the applicable requirements of a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
