Section 4.07          Securities Filings; Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities; Sarbanes-Oxley Act .(a)          Since January 1, 2013, Parent has timely filed all Parent Securities Documents. No such Parent Securities Document, as of its date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. All of the Parent Securities Documents, as of their respective dates (or, as of the date of any amendment to the respective Parent Securities Document), complied, as to form, in all material respects with U.S. Securities Laws. No Subsidiary of Parent is required to file any registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule, form, statement or other document with any applicable securities regulatory authority, including the SEC, and self-regulatory organization. Since the last day of the quarter end reported upon by Parent by the filing with the SEC of Parent’s most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, with respect to Parent and the Merger Sub, there has not been any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub.(b)          Each of the financial statements of Parent (including the related notes) included or incorporated by reference in the Parent Securities Documents (including any similar documents filed after the date of this Agreement) comply as to form and content in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and U.S. Securities Laws with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial statements).(c)          Except for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, since the date of the most recent consolidated balance sheet included in the Parent Securities Documents, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parent’s disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the management of Parent as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The management of Parent has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of Parent’s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. The management of Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of its system of internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, to Parent’s outside auditors and the audit committee of Parent’s board of directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect Parent’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent’s internal control over financial reporting.(d)          There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in any comment letters of the SEC or self-regulatory organization received by Parent relating to the Parent Securities Documents. Parent has heretofore made available to Company true, correct and complete copies of all written correspondence between Parent and the SEC occurring since January 1, 2013. None of the Parent Securities Documents is, to the knowledge of Parent, the subject of ongoing SEC or self-regulatory organization review.(e)          Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand) or any “off-balance sheet arrangements” (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parent’s financial statements or other Parent Securities Documents.(f)          Parent has heretofore furnished or made available to the Company complete and correct copies of all material amendments and modifications that have not been filed by Parent with the SEC to all agreements, documents and other instruments that previously had been filed by Parent with the SEC and are currently in effect.
