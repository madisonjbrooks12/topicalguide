Section 1.5 Assignment of Assigned Contracts and Assumed Leases .(a) To the maximum extent permitted by the Bankruptcy Code and subject to the other provisions of this Section 1.5 , the Sellers shall assume and transfer and assign all Acquired Assets to the Purchaser pursuant to Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any asset or any right thereunder if an attempted assignment without the consent of a third party, which consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing (after giving effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), would constitute a breach or in any way adversely affect the rights of the Purchaser or the Sellers thereunder. If with respect to any Acquired Asset such consent is not obtained or such assignment is not attainable pursuant to Sections 105, 363 or 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, then such Acquired Asset shall not be transferred hereunder and the Closing shall proceed with respect to the remaining Acquired Assets without any reduction in thePurchase Price. In the case of Contracts included in the Acquired Assets (i) that cannot be transferred or assigned effectively without the consent of third parties, which consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing (after giving effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), the Sellers shall, at the Purchaser’ sole expense and subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be required, reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser in endeavoring to obtain such consent and, if any such consent is not obtained, the Sellers shall, following the Closing, at the Purchaser’ sole expense and subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be required, cooperate with the Purchaser in all reasonable respects to provide to the Purchaser the benefits thereof in some other manner, or (ii) that are otherwise not transferable or assignable (after giving effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code), the Sellers shall, following the Closing, at the Purchaser’ sole expense and subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be required, reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser to provide to the Purchaser the benefits thereof in some other manner; provided, that nothing in this Section 1.5 shall (x) require any Seller or any Affiliate thereof to make any expenditure or incur any obligation on its own or on behalf of the Purchaser (unless funds in the full amount thereof are advanced to the Sellers in cash) or (y) prohibit or delay any Seller or any Affiliate thereof from ceasing operations or winding up its affairs following the Closing.(b) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Tax Laws (and to the extent consistent with the relevant arrangement agreed to by the Sellers and the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.5(a) ), the Sellers and the Purchaser agree to treat and report, and to cause their respective Affiliates to treat and report, on their Tax Returns, the Acquired Assets that are subject to the provisions of this Section 1.5 (the “ Non-Transferred Assets ”) as assets owned by the Purchaser or its designated Affiliates. Each Seller and Purchaser agrees to notify the other parties promptly in writing if it determines that such treatment (to the extent consistent with the relevant arrangement agreed to by the Sellers and the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.5(a) ) is not permitted under applicable Tax Laws. Where such treatment is not permitted under applicable Tax Laws, and subject to the terms of any relevant arrangement agreed to by the Sellers and the Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.5(a) , the amount of the liability for Taxes imposed on the Sellers or any of their Affiliates with respect to any Non-Transferred Asset for any Post-Closing Period for which the Purchaser and its designated Affiliates are responsible shall be calculated on a “with and without” basis.
