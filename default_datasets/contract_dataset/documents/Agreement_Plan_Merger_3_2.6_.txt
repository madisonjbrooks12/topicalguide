2.6   Earn-Out .(a)   In addition to the Consideration Shares, by virtue of the Merger, each share of Target Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive, if and when earned, any one or more earn-out payments (collectively, the “ Earn-Out ”) pursuant to this Section 2.6.  With respect to each $5,000,000 of Net Revenue on a cumulative basis of all Target Products collectively (each, an “ Earn-Out Milestone ”), the Earn-Out amount shall be $500,000 (each, an “ Earn-Out Payment ”); provided, however , that the aggregate Earn-Out payable hereunder shall under no circumstances exceed $2,500,000 (the “ Earn-Out Target ”).  For example, when Net Revenue of the Target Products on an aggregate basis reaches $5,000,000, the first cash payment of $500,000 will be made, and when the Net Revenue of Target Products on an aggregate basis (including the first $5,000,000) reaches $10,000,000, the second milestone payment of $500,000 will be made.(b)   From and after the first sale of Target Product and until the Earn-Out Target has been paid in full, within forty five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter from January through September, and within ninety (90) days after the fiscal year end for the fourth quarter ending in December (each, “ Reporting Date ”), the Acquiror shall deliver to the Stockholder Representative a written statement, certified by the Acquiror’s Chief Financial Officer, of the Net Revenue of all Target Products during such calendar quarter.  Each time an Earn-Out Milestone has been achieved, within thirty (30) days after the first Reporting Date to occur after the Earn Out Milestone has been achieved, the Acquiror shall deliver and pay to the Stockholder Representative the Earn-Out Payment corresponding to such Earn-Out Milestone.  The Stockholder Representative shall distribute the Earn-Out Payment to the Target Stockholders on a pro rata basis based on the Pre-Closing Ownership Percentages of the Target Stockholders. Acquiror and its Affiliates shall not sell or transfer the Target Product unless the purchaser or transferee is subject to the same obligation to make the Earn-Out Payments to the Target Stockholders as Acquiror and its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement.(c)   From and after the first sale of Target Product and until the Earn-Out Target has been paid in full, Acquiror shall make its books available to the Stockholder Representative and its agents for review, at the Stockholder Representative’s sole cost, upon advance notice, during business hours, provided that such parties may not collectively request more than one review in each calendar year.  If any such review shows that the Earn-Out paid by Acquiror as of the time of such audit is deficient, Acquiror shall promptly pay the deficient amount plus interest on the deficient amount, from the date such payment was due to the date of actual payment at a rate of one percent (1%) per month, or if lower, the maximum amount permitted under applicable Law.  If the Earn-Out payments made by Acquiror are found to be deficient by more than five percent (5%), Acquiror shall pay for all costs and expenses of Stockholder Representative associated with the audit.
